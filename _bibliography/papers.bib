author	= {Lingxiao Li and Yi Zhang and Shuhui Wang},
year	= {2023},
abstract = {Few-shot image generation is a challenging task since it aims to generate diverse new images for an unseen category with only a few images. Existing methods suffer from the trade-off between the quality and diversity of generated images. To tackle this problem, we propose Hyperbolic Attribute Editing(HAE), a simple yet effective method. Unlike prior arts that work in Euclidean space, HAE captures the hierarchy among images using data from seen categories in hyperbolic space. Given a well-trained HAE, images of unseen categories can be generated by moving the latent code of a given image toward any  meaningful directions in the Poincar√© disk with a fixing radius. Most importantly, the hyperbolic space allows us to control the semantic diversity of the generated images by setting different radii in the disk. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that HAE is capable of not only generating images with promising quality and diversity using limited data but achieving a highly controllable and interpretable editing process.},

title	= {Clinical Prompt Learning with Frozen Language Models},
abbr={TNNLS},
author={Niall Taylor* and Yi Zhang* and Dan Joyce and Alejo Nevado-Holgado and Andrey Kormilitzin},
year	= {2022},
abstract = {Prompt learning is a new paradigm in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field which has shown impressive performance on a number of natural language tasks with common benchmarking text datasets in full, few-shot, and zero-shot train-evaluation setups. Recently, it has even been observed that large but frozen pre-trained language models (PLMs) with prompt learning outperform smaller but fine-tuned models. However, as with many recent NLP trends, the performance of even the largest PLMs such as GPT-3 do not perform well on specialized domains (e.g. medical text), and the common practice to achieve State of the Art (SoTA) results still consists of pre-training and fine-tuning the PLMs on downstream tasks. The reliance on fine-tuning large PLMs is problematic in clinical settings where data is often held in non-GPU environments, and more resource efficient methods of training specialized domain models is crucial. We investigated the viability of prompt learning on clinically meaningful decision tasks and directly compared with more traditional fine-tuning methods. Results are partially in line with the prompt learning literature, with prompt learning able to match or improve on traditional fine-tuning with substantially fewer trainable parameters and requiring less training data. We argue that prompt learning therefore provides lower computational resource costs applicable to clinical settings, that can serve as an alternative to fine-tuning ever increasing in size PLMs.},
