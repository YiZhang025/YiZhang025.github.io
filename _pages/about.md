**Research:** Based in the Medical Imaging AI Lab at TU Delft and supervised by [Dr. Qian Tao](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/q.tao/?cHash=bab151eba5301c7840e42983dfa31164), I am interested in many aspects of medical image analysis, with a focus on cardiac MRI. My interests include **image registration**, **quantitative MRI**, **probabilistic deep learning**, and their clinical applications.

**Bio:** Before joining TU Delft, I completed a joint bachelor's degree in maths from the University of Manchester and Tianjin University, and master's degree in mathematical sciences from University of Oxford, supervised by [Prof. Yuji Nakatsukasa](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/nakatsukasa/). After my graduation, I worked as a full-time ML researcher at [Translational Neuroscience and Dementia Research Group](https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/research/dementia-research-group) at the University of Oxford, funded by GSK and NIHR.

Apart from academic life, I've been serving as a clarinet player since 2005: Mozart, Brahms, and some Debussy.
