<p><strong>Research:</strong> Based in the Medical Imaging AI Lab at TU Delft and supervised by <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/q.tao/?cHash=bab151eba5301c7840e42983dfa31164" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Qian Tao</a>, I am interested in many aspects of medical image analysis, with a focus on cardiac MRI. My interests include <strong>image registration</strong>, <strong>quantitative MRI</strong>, <strong>probabilistic deep learning</strong>, and their clinical applications.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Before joining TU Delft, I completed a joint bachelor’s degree in maths from the University of Manchester and Tianjin University, and master’s degree in mathematical sciences from University of Oxford, supervised by <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/nakatsukasa/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Yuji Nakatsukasa</a>. After my graduation, I worked as a full-time ML researcher at <a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/research/dementia-research-group" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Translational Neuroscience and Dementia Research Group</a> at the University of Oxford, funded by GSK and NIHR.</p>

<p>Apart from academic life, I’ve been serving as a clarinet player since 2005: Mozart, Brahms, and some Debussy.</p>
